# cipher-solutions

Welcome to the solutions repository for the Cryptography Wall Cyber Fair activity!

## How to Use This Repository

This repository contains solutions for all the ciphers featured in our classroom cryptography wall activity. The repository is organized by cipher type, making it easy to locate specific solutions.

## Finding Your Solution

Look at the "Hint" section on your cipher post-it
Find the corresponding folder in this repository
Locate your specific cipher text to see the decoded message

## Cipher Types Included

Caesar Cipher (alphabet shift)
Atbash Cipher (alphabet reversal)
Pigpen Cipher (geometric symbols)
Binary Code (ASCII to binary)
Morse Code (dots and dashes)
Base64 (text to base64 encoding)

###### Note: Try solving the cipher on your own first, using these solutions only as a last resort.

Try creating your own encoded messages using the same techniques

Remember: The goal is to learn cryptographic methods, not just to find the answer!
